    ```

### API Documentation

- **Swagger UI**: You can access the API documentation at:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/api-docs
    ```

    This page provides interactive documentation of the API endpoints and allows you to test them.

### Additional Information

- **Configuration**: Ensure you have a `.env` file for environment variables.

- **Test API**: Note that there is a test API included in the Swagger documentation. This endpoint is not functional yet, but it is present for future testing and development purposes.
